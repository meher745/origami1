                <h2>1. The wise owl</h2>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/rjsb921gUtA"><img src="./images/owl.jpg" width=300 height=250></a>
                <p>1. Start with a square piece of paper, coloured side up. Fold in half one way, then open. Then fold in half the other way and open.</p>
                <p>2. Turn the paper over to the white side. Fold the paper in half, crease well and open, and then fold again in the other direction.</p>
                <p>3. Using the creases you have made, bring the top 3 corners of the model down to the bottom corner. Flatten model.</p>
                <p>4. Fold top triangular flaps into the centre and unfold.</p>
                <p>5. Fold top of model downwards, crease well and unfold.</p>
                <p>6. Open the uppermost flap of the model, bringing it upwards and pressing the sides of the model inwards at the same time. Flatten down, creasing well. Turn model over and repeat steps 4-6 on the other side.</p>
                <p>7. Fold front flap down. Fold back flap down.</p>
                <p>8. On the top layer, fold the top corners in to the centre line, and repeat on back.</p>
                <p>9. Form the wing by lifting up from the inside, and twisting the wing forwards, then squashing down. Repeat for other wing.</p>
                <p>10. Fold the top of the model down. Fold back up along crease shown. Fold whole top down along crease shown.</p>
                <p>11. Cut ONLY TOP layer, along the line shown.</p>
                <p>12. Fold top flaps upwards to form feet. Turn owl over and cut slits through the top layer only. Turn back over and lift up the ears.</p>

                <h2>2. The beautiful bird</h2>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/NdC4NE-eT9E"><img src="./images/birds.jpg" width=300 height=250></a>
                <p> 1. Start with a square piece of origami paper. Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner. You should have an upside down triangle.</p>
                <p> 2. Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down. Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings.</p>
                <p> 3. Turn the paper over.Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up like this.</p>
                <p> 4. Fold the figure in half by folding the left side over to the right.</p>
                <p> 5. Now fold that same flap back like this to make one of the wings. Fold the other wing also.</p>
                <p> 6. Push the center of the head in and flatten. This is called an inside reverse fold.</p>

                <h2>3. The serene crane</h2>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Ux1ECrNDZl4"><img src="./images/crane.jpg" width=300 height=250></a>
                <p> 1. Start with the white side of the paper facing up and fold in half diagonally.</p>
                <p> 2. Fold in half again. </p>
                <p> 3. Open the square up, keeping the colored side down. Turn the square so that one of the corners is pointing at you. Bring the two side corners in to meet the corner on the table that's pointing at you. </p>
                <p> 4. Take the top corner that's still sticking up and press it down to join the other corners, creating an accordion folded square.</p>
                <p> 5. With the 'flap' corners still facing you, take the top right hand corner of the square and fold it into the center diagonal line of the square. The result of your folds will look a bit like the Superman logo shape. Repeat this with the left top corner.</p>
                <p> 6. Once both parts are folded in pull the top part down and press the crease.</p>
                <p> 7. After you have both halves of the triangle pulled in pull them back out and lift up the top piece of paper.Next, lift up the top front corner and hold down the other three front corners. Pull the top corner up.</p>
                <p> 8. Pull the top corner all the up and back so that the top piece lies flat. Carefully press all the folds down so that you end up with a diamond shape on top of the bottom diagonal square.</p>
                <p> 9. Flip the paper over and repeat Steps 5-8 to the other side.</p>
                <p> 10. Next, fold the right top corner of the diamond in to meet the center line. Press down that fold. Repeat this for the left top corner.</p>
                <p> 11. Flip the paper over and repeat the above steps for the other side.</p>
                <p> 12. Now, lift up the top right side and press it over to the other side, like turning a page in a book. Press down the middle fold. Flip the paper over and repeat this in the same direction, right to left, on the other side.</p>
                <p> 13. Lift up the wolfs snout and fold it so it meets with the tips of the ears. Press that new fold down. Flip the paper over and repeat on the other side.</p>
                <p> 14. Like you did in Step 10, fold the right side top layer of the paper in a book fold, from right to left. Flip the paper over and repeat on the other side.</p>
                <p> 15. Next, you pull out the long pieces of paper (the head/neck & tail). Pull them both out so that they line up with the angle of the body fold. Bend the top of one side down to make the head.</p>
                <p> 16. Fold both wings down where two different angles meet on the wing flaps. Press the folds.</p>
                <p> 17. To finish off the crane and make it able to stand, gently pull the wings apart where they're folded. Then turn the crane upside down and gently pull the opposite corners apart to finish opening up the body.</p>
